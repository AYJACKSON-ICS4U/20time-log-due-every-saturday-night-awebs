### Topic
**Kashyap and I** will be creating a file generation program for the school. It will generate a **.xls file from an .xls file**. The program will be created in **Java** using the Netbeans IDE.

#### Week 1 (Sep 18 - 22)

Started looking into my previous topic early in the week (learning system verilog), until the opportunity to create a converter for the school came up later in the week. The rest of the week was trying to understand what the script for the school was supposed to accomplish.

#### Week 2 (Sep 25 - 29)

Received more information about our scripts purpose and what language to write it in. We learned we should write the script in Java and will be converting a documents downloaded from google docs into a spreadsheet file.

#### Week 3 (Oct 2 - 6)

Created a simple GUI in Netbeans that allows a user to import a file, view the file in a text box, click a convertion button (does not do anything) and a textbox to output errors and status of the program during runtime.

#### Week 4 (Oct 9 - 13)

Had a meeting with guidence to learn more specifically what we will be doing and learned will be re-formating and adding data to an existing spreadsheet file. Made some changes to the GUI after learning we will be generating .xls from .xls. In addition, I changed the code used last week to import a .xls file using the apache poi external library (also spend the week learning this library).

#### Week 5 (Oct 16 - Oct 20)

Refamilarized myself with [java concepts](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/concepts/index.html) (subclasses, superclasses, interfaces etc). Continued on Apache Poi library learning. Overall a slow week from other projects and no class time.

#### Week 6 (Oct 23 - 27)

Made progress towards GUI interface. Action buttons will be on the right side of the screen with an optional text status for the button beside it. This makes the inferface simple, easy to understand and work with. Added a **current file open text** beside the open a file button. Program status will now correctly display when there is a problem opening a file, when a file has been opened and when the file chooser has been closed.
