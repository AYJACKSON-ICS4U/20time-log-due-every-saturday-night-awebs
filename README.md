### Topic
**Kashyap and I** will be creating a file generation program for the school. It will generate a **.xls file from an .xls file**. The program will be created in **Java** using the Netbeans IDE.

#### Week 1 (Sep 18 - 22)

Started looking into my previous topic early in the week (learning system verilog), until the opportunity to create a converter for the school came up later in the week. The rest of the week was trying to understand what the script for the school was supposed to accomplish.

#### Week 2 (Sep 25 - 29)

Received more information about our scripts purpose and what language to write it in. We learned we should write the script in Java and will be converting a documents downloaded from google docs into a spreadsheet file.

#### Week 3 (Oct 1 - 6)

Created a simple GUI in Netbeans that allows a user to import a file, view the file in a text box, click a convertion button (does not do anything) and a textbox to output errors and status of the program during runtime. 

#### Week 4 (Oct 9 - 13)

Had a meeting with guidence to learn more specifically what we will be doing and learned will be re-formating and adding data to an existing spreadsheet file. Made some changes to the GUI after learning we will be generating .xls from .xls. In addition, I changed the code used last week to import a .xls file using the apache poi external library (also spend the week learning this library).
